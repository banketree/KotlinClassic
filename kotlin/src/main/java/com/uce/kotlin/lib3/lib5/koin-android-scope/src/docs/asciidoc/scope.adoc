== Scope features for Android

The `koin-android-scope` project is dedicated to bring Android scope features to the existing Scope API.

=== Gradle setup

Choose the `koin-android-scope` dependency to add to your Gradle project (android or androix version):

[source,gradle,subs="attributes"]
----
// Add Jcenter to your repositories if needed
repositories {
    jcenter()
}
dependencies {
    // Scope for Android
    implementation 'org.koin:koin-android-scope:{revnumber}'
    // or Scope for AndroidX
    implementation 'org.koin:koin-androidx-scope:{revnumber}'
}
----

=== Taming the Android lifecycle

Android components are mainly managed by their lifecycle: we can't directly instantiate an Activity nor a Fragment. The system
make all creation and management for us, and make callbacks on methods: onCreate, onStart...

That's why we can't describe our Activity/Fragment/Service in a Koin module. We need then to inject dependencies into properties and also
respect the lifecycle: Components related to the UI parts must be released on soon as we don't need them anymore.

Then we have:

* long live components (Services, Data Repository ...) - used by several screens, never dropped
* medium live components (user sessions ...) - used by several screens, must be dropped after an amount of time
* short live components (views) - used by only one screen & must be dropped at the end of the screen

Long live components can be easily described as `single` definitions. For medium and short live components we can have several approaches.

In the case of MVP architecture style, the `Presenter` is a short live component to help/support the UI. The presenter must be created each time the screen is showing,
and dropped once the screen is gone.

.A new Presenter is created each time
[source,kotlin]
----
class DetailActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    // injected Presenter
    override val presenter : Presenter by inject()
----

We can describe it in a module:


* as `factory` - to produce a new instance each time the `by inject()` or `get()` is called

[source,kotlin]
----
val androidModule = module {

    // Factory instance of Presenter
    factory { Presenter() }
}
----

* as `scope` - to produce an instance tied to a scope

[source,kotlin]
----
val androidModule = module {

    scope("scope_id") { Presenter() }
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Most of Android memory leaks comes from referencing a UI/Android component from a non Android component. The system keeps a reference
on it and can't totally drop it via garbage collection.

=== Binding scope to lifecycle

Koin gives the `bindScope` function to bind the actual Android component lifecycle, to a given scope. On lifecycle's end, this will close the bound scope.


[source,kotlin]
----
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    // inject Presenter instance, tied to current "scope_id" scope
    val presenter : Presenter by inject()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        // bind current lifecycle to Activity's scope
        bindScope(getScope("scope_id"))
    }
----


=== Sharing instances between components with scopes

In a more extended usage, you can use a `Scope` instance across components. For example, if we need to share a `UserSession` instance.

First declare a scope definition:

[source,kotlin]
----
module {
    // Shared user session data
    scope("session") { UserSession() }
}
----

When needed to begin use a `UserSession` instance, create a scope for it:

[source,kotlin]
----
getKoin().createScope("session")
----

Then use it anywhere you need it:

[source,kotlin]
----
class MyActivity1 : AppCompatActivity() {

    // inject Presenter instance, tied to current MyActivity's scope
    val userSession : UserSession by inject()
}
class MyActivity2 : AppCompatActivity() {

    // inject Presenter instance, tied to current MyActivity's scope
    val userSession : UserSession by inject()
}
----

or you can also inject it with Koin DSL. If a presenter need it:

[source,kotlin]
----
class Presenter(val userSession : UserSession)
----

Just inject it into constructor, with the right scope:

[source,kotlin]
----
module {
    // Shared user session data
    scope("session") { UserSession() }
    // Inject UserSession instance from "session" Scope
    factory { Presenter(get())}
}
----

When you have to finish with your scope, just close it:

[source,kotlin]
----
val session = getKoin().getScope("session")
session.close()
----
